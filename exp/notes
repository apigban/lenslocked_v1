#6.3.2
    Create a *View* Type
    solves: too many repetitive blocks:
    - main.go 
        -  parsing html/layout files 
        -  errors
        -  use of globals

    - catch errors when parsing layout files
        - panic before template is executed/rendered
#6.3.3
    Use the *View* type
    - change both template variables to become views
    - update main to create instance of views instead of templates
    - handlerfuncs for home/contact needs to be updated to use the view Type
    
    Create the "Bootstrap" Layout
    - Update View type to use bootstrap Layout
    - Update main.go to sync changes with view type
